# Javascript-To-Do-List
A basic to do list in the form of groceries. You can add items to the list by typing in the input field, and either clicking enter or using the enter key on your keyboard. You can delete items when you add them to the list. When you have gotten your item, you can click on the text of that item to cross it off the list, or click again to remove the line through it.
